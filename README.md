# PWA Blocker

Websites are now offering PWAs. Not every organization wants to allow the installation. 
This extension on load creates and observer to remove the manifest responsible for PWAs and the offer to install. 

Managed Extenstion use allows the escaping of urls added to the admin console extension JSON as an array of domains.
```
{ "escape" : {"Value" : ["domain.com", "example.com"]}}
```
